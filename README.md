# Alexa-Feedback-Prediction
Project Description

Project Introduction

This project aims to leverage various Machine Learning algorithms to predict sentiment based on feedback received for Amazon Alexa products. Sentiment analysis involves determining whether a piece of text, such as a review, expresses a positive or negative sentiment. By analyzing the feedback, the project seeks to identify which algorithm provides the most accurate predictions, thereby helping businesses understand customer satisfaction and areas for improvement. This analysis can also guide marketing strategies, product development, and customer service enhancements.

Project Aim

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate classification models that can predict the sentiment of Amazon Alexa reviews as either positive (1) or negative (0). By comparing different machine learning algorithms, the goal is to determine which model performs best in terms of accuracy and other relevant performance metrics. The project will involve data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization to achieve the most reliable predictive performance.

Details of Features:

The dataset consists of several columns, each providing specific information about the reviews:

Rating:

This column contains the product rating given by the customer, typically on a scale from 1 to 5. The rating can provide insights into the overall satisfaction of the customer with the product.

Date:

This column records the date when the product was rated. It can be useful for analyzing trends over time and understanding seasonal variations in customer feedback.

Variation:

This column indicates the specific variation of the product reviewed (e.g., different colors, sizes, or versions of the Alexa device). It helps in identifying which variations are more positively or negatively received by customers.

Verified Reviews:

This column contains the actual text of the verified reviews provided by customers. It is the primary source of data for sentiment analysis, as it includes the subjective opinions and experiences of the customers.
Feedback:

This column is the target variable for the classification models. It is binary, with 1 indicating a positive sentiment and 0 indicating a negative sentiment. This column will be used to train and evaluate the predictive models.
